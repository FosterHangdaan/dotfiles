# Overview
Dotfiles are configuration files used to customize the look and behaviour of a UNIX-based system. The configuration files contained within this repository belong to me and I share it to the public in the hope that someone may find it useful.

I advise that you first attempt to understand the contents of the files before applying any of the settings to your own configuration. I am not liable for any damages that may occur from the use of my configuration files either in whole or in part.
